## Targets
Nerves applications are configured that they can produce images for target
hardware by setting `MIX_TARGET`. By default, if `MIX_TARGET` is not set, the
mix.exs defaults to building a host target. This is useful for executing logic
tests, running utilities, and debugging. For more information about targets:
https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/targets.html#content

## Getting Started

To start your Nerves app:
  * `export MIX_TARGET=my_target` or prefix every command with
    `MIX_TARGET=my_target`. For example, `MIX_TARGET=rpi3`
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create firmware with `mix firmware`
  * Burn to an SD card with `mix firmware.burn`
